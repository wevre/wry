section : Introduction

	An HTML document is built using HTML elements. Elements include start and end
	tags, attributes and content. Content can be text or child elements, nested
	to arbitrary levels. See {W3C HTML syntax}[*elem-url].

	elem-url : https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html

	HTMLElementComposer, or Composer for short, is an object to help compose
	proper HTML. Composer keeps track of nested elements. It can indent the
	output for easier reading or debugging by humans. For some quick examples,
	see the [*Tests] section.

	Composer deals with HTML at a low level: tags, attributes, and content. It is
	designed such that other objects can inherit and provide more specific
	functionality. For example, a FormBuilder object could use Composer to deal
	with low-level HTML details, and provide a higher level API for `addButton`,
	`addInputField`, etc.

section : Creating an element

	The core work of Composer is creating elements. The `getElement` function
	below takes an element name, attributes, and content and returns a string of
	the composed HTML element. Attributes and content are optional. By default, a
	closing tag is not generated and elements are left open in anticipation of
	subsequent content. Pass `close=true` to change that behavior and close the
	element with an end tag. Note that {void elements}[*Void elements] take no
	content and are always closed with ' \>' regardless of the flag.

	The arguments to `getElement` should be valid HTML but the function does not
	enforce that. It transforms the keys and values in the `attribs` argument
	into HTML attributes, wrapping the values in double quotes. Those values
	should not themselves contain unescaped double quotes. The `content` argument
	will be composed untouched as the HTML element content.

	`getElement` is a true function. It does not change any state or store any
	output, it simply returns a string of HTML. Notably, it does not keep track
	of previously opened elements and thus has no mechanism to close them. All of
	that will be handled with the next batch of functions.

	>>> Element functions

func getElement   # ([elem], attribs=(), content='', close=false)
	$arg.elem ?= $arg[0]
	guard elem
		return
	'<' + elem
	for attribs
		' ' + key + '="' + val + '"'
	if isEmptyElement(elem)   # See [*Note static]
		' />'
	else
		'>'
		content
		if close
			'</' + elem + '>'
	return $loc->concat()   # See [*Note loc concat]

		I'm using # throughout this document to create a comment, but I also had
		notes to use that as a badge for marking scopes. Maybe comments need to be
		marked with something else, like `//`.

	note : Note static
		Functions `getElement` and `isEmptyElement` operate somewhat like "static"
		methods, in that they don't technically need an object context and don't
		change any state. They will be called, however, by the other methods of
		HTMLElementComposer and so will automatically inherit an object scope.
		That is needed, by the way, in for `getElement` to call `isEmptyElement`.

	note : Note loc concat
		The `getElement` function, as with the `getIndent` function below, builds
		up its return value by adding expressions to the local context. This can
		get tricky if the code includes setting variables, which would then also
		be in the local context and included in the final concat. To avoid this,
		we set values in a different context (typically $arg) so that local
		contains only our desired results expressions.

	The next set of functions comprise the main API of Composer. They use
	`getElement` defined above to generate output, which is stored internally;
	and they manage nested elements, which are tracked in an internal stack.
	These functions are:

	* `beginElement`
	* `endElement`
	* `addElement`
	* `addCustom`
	* `getHTML`

	Open an element with a call to `beginElement` and close it with a matching
	call to `endElement`. For an element that doesn't (or can't) take children,
	add the entire element, including start and end tag, with a call to
	`addElement`. Add arbitrary HTML by calling `addCustom`. All these calls
	accumulate output in an internal store. Retrieve the final HTML, and reset
	the internal store, with a call to `getHTML`.

	It is common to have 'class' as the only attribute on an HTML element. Rather
	than embed a 'class' key-value pair as the only item in the `attribs` array,
	it can be passed on its own with the `class` parameter to `beginElement` and
	`addElement`. This cleans up the call site for a common scenario. The
	following two lines are equivalent.

	```
		composer->addElement('p', attribs=(class='greet'), content='Hello World!')
		composer->addElement('p', class='greet', content='Hello World!')

	Note the functions below have placeholders for handling indentation, which
	will be dealt with later in this document.

	>>> Element functions

func beginElement   # ([elem], attribs=(), content='', class=nil)
	$arg.elem ?= $arg[0]
	guard elem
		return
	if isEmptyElement(elem) with
		'`beginElement` called with void element '
		'"' + elem + '". '
		'Use `addElement` instead.'
		throw (msg=$loc->concat())
	if class
		attribs['class'] = class
	tagStack->push(elem)   # See [*Note writing variables]
	<*Handle indentation>
	store[] = getElement(elem, ~attribs, ~content)

func endElement
	elem = tagStack->pop()
	guard elem
		throw (msg='Too many calls to endElement')
	<*Handle indentation>
	store[] = '</' + elem + '>'

func addElement   # ([elem], attribs=(), content='', class=nil)
	$arg.elem ?= $arg[0]
	guard elem
		return
	if class
		attribs['class'] = class
	<*Handle indentation>
	store[] = getElement(elem, ~attribs, ~content, close: true)

func addCustom   #([string])
	$arg.string ?= $arg[0]
	store[] = string

func getHTML   # (reset=true)
	guard tagStack->isEmtpy()
		throw (msg='There are unclosed elements')
	reset ?= true
	defer if reset
		$obj.store = ()
	return store->concat()

	<<<

	note : Note writing variables
		Earlier version had all the references to `tagStack` and `store` prefixed
		with explicit `$obj` context. But that shouldn't be necessary. Assigning a
		new value to an object would definitely need the $obj prefix, (like
		resetting `store` in `getHTML`) or else the variable would just be created
		in `$loc`. But if we refer to an existing variable and then chain it to a
		function call or use subscripting, that object reference has to be
		resolved and once resolved the found object can be changed directly.

section : HTMLElementComposer object

	Here is the overall structure of the HTMLElementComposer. The
	{element functions}[*Element functions] have already been defined, and the
	remaining pieces will be defined below.

	>>> HTMLElementComposer

HTMLElementComposer

	<*Internal variables>

	<*Element functions>

	<*Indentation>

	<*Empty elements>

<*Tests>

	<<<

	The element functions rely on internal variables to keep track of nested
	elements and accumulated output. Those variables have already been referenced
	by the functions, with the names `tagStack` and `store`, respectively. They
	are defined next.

	!!!
		Technically in Wry it is not necessary to set these variables when their
		starting value is nil or nil-equivalent. But it is good practice to be
		explicit, and IDE's can pick up on the variable names and provide
		autocomplete suggestions.

	>>> Internal variables
store = ''
tagStack = ()
	<<<

section : Indentation

	Most white space is ignored when parsing HTML, indentation is a convenience
	for human readers, and can be especially helpful when debugging. Composer
	will indent the output HTML if the flag `fIndent` is set to true. By default
	it uses a tab character to indent, but that can be changed by setting the
	`indentChar` to something else.

	>>> Internal variables
fIndent = true
indentChar = "\t"
	<<<

	The following function derives the indentation level from the level of nested
	elements and returns a string of repeated `indentChar`'s.

	>>> Indentation

func getIndent
	guard fIndent
		return
	if store   # Add a newline if `store` contains existing output.
		"\n"
	$arg.i = 0
	do i < tagStack->count()
		indentChar
		continue $arg.i += 1
	return $loc->concat()

	<<<

	With the `getIndentation` function defined, the placeholder for handling
	indentation back in the {element functions}[*Element functions] can now be
	completed.

	>>> Handle indentation
store[] = getIndent()
	<<<

section : Void elements

	Void elements take no content. See {HTML5 void elements}[*void-elem]. The
	`getElement` function will automatically close them. To do so, the array
	`empty` contains the void elements defined for HTML5 (as keys) and the
	`isEmptyElement` function returns true if the supplied `elem` is in the
	`empty` list; false otherwise.
