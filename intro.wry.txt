section : Introduction

	Welcome to `wry`. This file serves as documentation for `wry` while at the 
	same team being a fully functional `wry` script. You might be reading this as
	PDF or HTML output, which is fine, but to really understanding how a `wry` 
	script works, it's best to read this in its raw, unprocessed, plain text 
	glory, which you can find on the {wry website}[https://wry-lang.org].

	A `wry` script is comprised of blocks of prose and blocks of code mixed 
	together in the same file.

	Prose is the text you write to explain and document your script. It's meant 
	to be extremely readable in its raw form; and, by following some simple 
	conventions, it can be serialized into other useful output such as XML, HTML,
	or PDF.

	Code is the set of instructions that will be executed by the interpreter. 
	It's syntax is, understandably, more rigid than prose. But you have the 
	flexibility in a `wry` script of building up your code in pieces, laying them
	out in a logical way, and linking them together. Does this sound like 
	{literate programming}[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming]? 
	That's not an accident.

section : Quick example

	Let's look at a quick example, even before attempting to explain everything 
	that is going on, with the venerable "Hello world". Everything you've read so
	far is written in prose, but we need to switch to code. To switch into code 
	use the marker `>>>` or `<<<`; and to switch out use the other one.

	Indentation is significant in a `wry` script, and the code markers are no 
	exception: they must be indented at a level consistent with surrounding 
	prose. Between the markers the indentation level of the code block resets to 
	the left margin.

	>>> Hello world example

print("Hello world")

	<<<

	And we're back in prose mode again. Welcome back.

	If you wanted to execute the above block, you would enter something similar 
	to the following at the command line:

	terminal : Submitting the "Hello world example" code block
		prompt : $
		input : wry --block "Hello world example" $(SCRIPT_NAME)
		output : Hello world

	!!!
		The above "terminal" block is multi-purpose. In generated documentation it
		displays styled as a sample terminal session. It can also function as a 
		test script. See [*Test scripts].

	Before we move on with other code examples, let's learn
	how a `wry` script is organized.

section : Anatomy of a wry script

	A `wry` script file is organized into hierarchical blocks. The outer-most 
	block by default is "root", and contains child blocks of prose and code.

	Blocks are created by typing a name and then indenting the content of the 
	block below that name. Blocks can optionally be given a title by typing a 
	colon and title after the name. For example, you might divide your file into 
	sections, each one written as a block, with titles for each section:

	``` Sample section organization
		section : Introduction
			<stuff in the introduction>
		section : Chapter 1
			<stuff in the first chapter>

	callout : Convenient titles
		You can also designate a title with a named field within the block. For 
		example, here is another way to lay out the sections in [*Sample section 
		organization] that produces the same logical structure:

		``` Section organization using named fields
			section
				title : Introduction

				#stuff in the Introduction

			section
				title : Chapter 1

				#stuff in Chapter 1

		As demonstrated above, `title` is a named field within each `section` 
		block. You can create any fields you want. By default, `wry` pays special 
		attention to `title` fields on blocks, hence the convenience of providing 
		the title on the same line as the named block.
		
		###
			Haven't really defined a `named field` yet, but used that term in the 
			paragraph above.

	Some blocks are defined with markers, rather than arbitrary names. A block of
	sample code, for example, is created with a marker of three backticks 
	````````. Just as with named blocks, you can provide titles for marked 
	blocks, but the colon is optional.

	Many marked blocks also take "flavors" which are denoted in parenthesis after
	the marker. For example, to create a sample code block with a title and also 
	indicate that it should be treated as C code:

	``` :
		```(c) : Hello world example in C
			void main() {
				print("Hello world");
			}

	Another type of block is executable code, or more simply a "code block". This
	block has two markers, one to enter code and one to exit. Another important 
	difference with a code block: inside the block, the indentation is reset to 
	the left margin.

section : Code blocks

section : Refering to code

	It is expected that you will have lots to say about your script, so a `wry` 
	file always starts out in prose mode. Sometimes you want to refer to code but
	have the interpreter ignore it. In other words, you want to write about code,
	not write code for execution. You can mark a block as code that should be 
	displayed (not executed) with the marker ````````. That's three backticks in 
	a row. Following that marker you can optionally indicate the language of the 
	block, which can produce, depending on your setup, code with syntax 
	highlighting, numbering, etc.

	Here is an example:

	```
		``` wry
			print("Hello world")

	Which will look like this when you generate documentation:

	``` wry
		print("Hello world")

	!!!
		If you are viewing this file in it's raw form, meaning the original `.wry`
		file, then everything above will look a little repetitive. The first block
		shows an example of how to include some sample code, and the second block
		is a true code sample. If that is confusing, try viewing the generated
		documentation. (In which, by the way, you won't see this block at all,
		because it's a `reference` block and by default is not included in the
		documentation.)

	This looks very similar to the "Hello world example" above, but it will not 
	be executed by the interpreter. Instead, when generating documentation for
	this file, the above block will be shown as a code sample, perhaps with 
	syntax highlighting. Depending on your environment, you can include sample 
	code from a variety of languages (not just wry) in your documentation.
